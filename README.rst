Ndebele Notes

About
=====

Ndebele is a language spoken by the Ndebele people (mostly) in Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. It is similar to Zulu and is a member of the Bantu family of languages, which also includes Swahili (although the differences are great).

These are the notes I have made whilst learning Ndebele with a native speaker from Zimbabwe.
